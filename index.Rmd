#A long-term restoration experiment at Rancho Marino Reserve.

###Purpose
To explore existing evidence and data empirically and assess future research activities including sampling.

###Methods
I did throw out the control macroplots, as it seemed like a waste of resources to plant pugs into them.
From data sheet columns:
Plot   12x12m(12 setup & originally sampled, but as you noted control sites weren't uses) 
Subplot 3x3m (4 per plot)  
Quadrat 1x1m (5 per Subplot) 

###Meta-data
Don Canestro
In summary, 4 years of sampling 1 before and three after planning.
I also have data on plug grow out and which spp. seeds had best germination rates.
I also have plot images from 2006 and 2009.
Between 2002 before data and 2006 data collection was kill time.  I was told by restoration experts 3 years of death on a plot was good to remove seed bank and reduce competition

Below are descriptions of the attached files.
